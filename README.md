# (My) Stuff

Simple snippets I'm using in different projects. 

## Packages

- [@jurijtokarski/cache](https://github.com/jurijtokarski/stuff/tree/master/packages/cache) in-memory cache class.
- [@jurijtokarski/times](https://github.com/jurijtokarski/stuff/tree/master/packages/times) simple time converting to miliseconds.
- [@jurijtokarski/calc](https://github.com/jurijtokarski/stuff/tree/master/packages/calc) math and arrays calculation helpers.
- [@jurijtokarski/hash](https://github.com/jurijtokarski/stuff/tree/master/packages/hash) hash and ID generator helpers.

## Why?

While I was searching some snippent in my previous project I've recognized, that I should prepare such simple library with snippets for future usage.
